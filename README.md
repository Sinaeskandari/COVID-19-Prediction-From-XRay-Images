# COVID-19-Prediction-From-XRay-Images
Implementation of [paper](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deep-covid-predicting-covid-19-from-chest-x) using pytorch on [this dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9w8nmj791c9ogsx/data_upload_v3.zip) for final project of deep learning course.

The following steps were done in the project:

1. Data augmentation methods were used to increase the size of training data.

2. The pre-trained ResNet-18 was utilized and with approach of transfer learning, the model was fine-tuned on the new data.
